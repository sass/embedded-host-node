# Problem

The npm post-install hook provides no way to differentiate a developer who runs
`npm install` to develop this package from an end-user who runs `npm install` to
get the package from npm. Only end-users need to download the Embedded Compiler
binary during post-install.

# Solution

This file only exists in this package's repo. It is excluded from the tarball
published to npm. During post-install, we first verify that this file does not
exist before downloading the compiler.

See: `./download-compiler-for-end-user.js`
