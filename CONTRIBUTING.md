## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Large Language Models

Do not submit any code or prose written or modified by large language models or
"artificial intelligence" such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT to this project.
These tools produce code that looks plausible, which means that not only is it
likely to contain bugs those bugs are likely to be difficult to notice on
review. In addition, because these models were trained indiscriminately and
non-consensually on open-source code with a variety of licenses, it's not
obvious that we have the moral or legal right to redistribute code they
generate.

## Release process

Because this package's version remains in lockstep with the current version of
Dart Sass, it's not released manually from this repository. Instead, a release
commit is automatically generated once a new Embedded Dart Sass version has been
released, which in turn is automatically triggered by a release of Dart Sass. As
such, manual commits should never:

* Update the `package.json`'s version to a non-`-dev` number. Changing it from
  non-`-dev` to dev when adding a new feature is fine.

* Update the `package.json`'s `"compiler-version"` field to a non-`-dev` number.
  Changing it from non-`-dev` to dev when using a new feature is fine.

## Keeping in Sync With Other Packages

The embedded host depends on several different components which come from
different repositories:

* The [Dart Sass compiler].
* The [Sass embedded protocol].
* The [Sass JS API definition].

[Dart Sass compiler]: https://github.com/sass/dart-sass
[Sass embedded protocol]: https://github.com/sass/sass/tree/main/spec/embedded-protocol.md
[JS API definition]: https://github.com/sass/sass/tree/main/spec/js-api

These dependencies are made available in different ways depending on context.

### Local Development

When developing locally, you can download all of these dependencies by running
`npm run init`. This provides the following options for `compiler` (for the
embedded compiler), `protocol` (for the embedded protocol), and `api` (for the
JS API):

* `--<type>-path`: The local filesystem path of the package to use. This is
  useful when doing local development on both the host and its dependencies at
  the same time.

* `--<type>-ref`: A Git reference for the GitHub repository of the package to
  clone.

By default:

* This uses the version of the embedded protocol and compiler specified by
  `protocol-version` in `package.json`, *unless* that version ends in `-dev` in
  which case it checks out the latest revision on GitHub.

* This uses the embedded compiler version and JS API definition from the latest
  revision on GitHub.

* This uses the Dart Sass version from the latest revision on GitHub, unless the
  `--compiler-path` was passed in which case it uses that version of Dart Sass.

### Continuous Integration

CI tests also use `npm run init`, so they use the same defaults as local
development. However, if the pull request description includes a link to a pull
request for Dart Sass, the embedded protocol, or the JS API, this will check out
that version and run tests against it instead.

### Release

When this package is released to npm, it downloads the embedded protocol version
that matches `protocol-version` in `package.json`. It downloads the latest JS
API revision on GitHub.

The release version of the `sass-embedded` package does *not* include Dart Sass.
Instead, we release optional packages of the form `sass-embedded-<os>-<arch>`.
Each of these contains the published version of Dart Sass that matches
`compiler-version` in `package.json` for the given operating system/architecture
combination.

If either `protocol-version` or `compiler-version` ends with `-dev`, the release
will fail.

**Note:** As part of the holistic release process for Dart Sass, the embedded
compiler's CI will automatically update this repository's `package.json` file
with the latest `compiler-version` and optional dependency versions before
tagging it for a release.
